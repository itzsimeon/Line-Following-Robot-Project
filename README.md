# Line Following Robot Project
 

# INTRODUCTION

LINE-FOLLOWING ROBOT: is a tye of Robot that can dectect and follow a specific path or line drawn on the ground. It uses sensors, usually infrared or colour sensors. The line usually has a colour with a high contrast. For instance, black on a white surface or vice versa.
They are used in carrying out tasks such as Material Handling, Products Assembly in manufacturing and also warehousing companies. 

Some of the materials used for this project are Arduino UNO Board, Car Chassis, TT Gear Motor, Infrared Sensor, L293N Motor Driver.


# ABOUT 

A line-following robot project is all about building an autonomous robot which can detect and follow a line drawn on the ground. The main goal of this project is to teach people about robotics, programming, and how sensors work.

In this project, you'll design the robot using materials like wheels, motors, and a microcontroller. You'll also add sensors that help the robot see the line.

Once it's built, you'll program the microcontroller to control the motors based on the input from the sensors. This way, the robot can follow the line automatically without any human intervention or without any deviation.
It's a fun and educational project!
 
# COMPONENTS 

HARDWARE COMPONENTS 
Car Chassis: This is the frame of your robot. It provides the structure and support for all the other components.

TT Gear Motor: This motor is responsible for driving the wheels of your robot. They convert electrical energy from the Arduino into mechanical energy.

Arduino Uno Board: This is the microcontroller that processes the signals from the sensors and sends commands to the motors. It runs the program that controls the robot's movement.

L293N Motor Driver: This component allows the Arduino to control the direction and speed of the TT gear motors. It acts as an interface between the microcontroller and the motors.

Infrared Sensors: These sensors detect the line on the ground. They send signals to the Arduino to let it know whether the Line-Following robot is on the line or needs to adjust its path.

Each hardware component plays a very important role in making your line-following robot.

SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
Proteus: This software is used for circuit simulation and PCB design. You can create and test your circuit virtually, which helps you identify any issues before you build the physical robot. Itâ€™s helpful for visualizing how all the components will work together.

Arduino IDE: This is where you write and upload your code to the Arduino UNO board. It allows you to configure the code for your Line-Following Robot.

# CIRCUIT STRUCTURE




















# HOW THE LINE-FOLLOWING ROBOT WORKS

As the robot moves, the Infrared sensors continuously check for the line. When a sensor detects the line (indicating it's over a darker surface), it sends a signal to the Arduino.

The Arduino then reads the signals from the Infrared sensors. If both sensors detect the line, the robot moves straight. If one sensor detects the line, the Arduino determines which direction to turn.

Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino sends commands to the L293N motor driver. For instance, if the left sensor detects the line, the Arduino might slow down the left motor or stop it to steer the robot back toward the line.

The L293N motor driver receives the commands from the Arduino and adjusts the speed and direction of the TT gear motors accordingly. This allows the robot to follow the line smoothly.

This loop continues as the robot moves, ensuring it stays on the path.

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this line-following robot project shows how different parts like sensors, an Arduino, and motors can work together to make a robot follow a line on its own. By programming the Arduino and adjusting the sensors, the robot can stay on track.

This project helps us understand basic robotics and control systems. Plus, it gives us a good starting point for more advanced projects in the future.
